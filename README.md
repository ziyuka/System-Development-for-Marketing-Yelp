# RecSy: System Development for Marketing
For this research, Stan Zwartkruis and Ziya Karaca, two MSc students at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS) who were following the course "Digital Driven Business" during the study year 2023-2024, utilized a subset of this dataset. This subset consisted of 150,000 data points, selected from the various JSON files provided by the Yelp Dataset. These samples then underwent a categorization process, where the different types of businesses were grouped according to their categories. It was found that 'restaurants' emerged as the largest category. Furthermore, the research honed in on the geographical distribution of these restaurant categories, identifying the most frequent state within the U.S. where these restaurants are located.

The focal point of the research was to develop a multilayer perceptron (MLP) such as Fast Influence Analysis (FIA) combined with ACCENT algorithm for generating counterfactuals, first, by identifying the most prominent category within the dataset.
