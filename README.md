# RecSy: System Development for Marketing
For this research, Stan Zwartkruis and Ziya Karaca, two MSc students at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS) who were following the course "Digital Driven Business". During the study year 2023-2024, both students utilized a subset of this dataset. This subset consisted of 150,000 data points, selected from the various JSON files provided by the Yelp Dataset. These samples then underwent a categorization process, where the different types of businesses were grouped according to their categories. It was found that 'restaurants' emerged as the largest category. Furthermore, the research zoomed in on the geographical distribution of these restaurant categories, identifying the most frequent state within the U.S. where these restaurants are located.

The focal point of the research was to develop a multilayer perceptron (MLP) such as Fast Influence Analysis (FIA) combined with ACCENT algorithm for generating counterfactuals, first, by identifying the most prominent category within the dataset. Through this analysis, it was found that 'restaurants' emerged as the largest category. Furthermore, the research honed in on the geographical distribution of these restaurant categories, identifying the most frequent state within the U.S. where these restaurants are located.

The Yelp Dataset is a valuable resource for academic research, teaching, and learning. It provides a rich collection of real-world data related to businesses, reviews, and user interactions. Here are the key details about the Yelp Dataset: Reviews: A whopping 6,990,280 reviews from users. Businesses: Information on 150,346 businesses. Pictures: A collection of 200,100 pictures. Metropolitan Areas: Data from 11 metropolitan areas. Tips: Over 908,915 tips provided by 1,987,897 users. Business Attributes: Details like hours, parking availability, and ambiance for more than 1.2 million businesses. Aggregated Check-ins: Historical check-in data for each of the 131,930 businesses.

This code implements a content-based filtering recommendation system using a machine learning model (a Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) for predicting star ratings of restaurants based on features like latitude, longitude, review_count, and is_open. After training the model, it uses the predicted ratings to generate restaurant recommendations for a randomly selected user.
